## Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, addressing a critical real-world challenge faced by financial institutions globally. Credit card fraud not only results in significant monetary losses but also erodes customer trust and can disrupt financial operations.

Using a publicly available dataset that simulates real transaction data, the project demonstrates how data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced classification algorithms can be combined to build an effective fraud detection pipeline. Special attention is given to handling imbalanced data—a common scenario in fraud detection—by employing techniques such as resampling and precision-focused evaluation metrics.

The solution explores multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, to maximize detection accuracy and minimize false positives. The workflow mirrors practical applications in banking and payment processing, where real-time identification of suspicious activities is vital for security and compliance.

**Key Features:**
- Real-world dataset representing genuine and fraudulent transactions
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization
- Handling severe class imbalance typical in fraud detection tasks
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison using industry-standard metrics
- (Optional) Deployment-ready code for real-time prediction scenarios

By simulating end-to-end fraud detection, this project provides a comprehensive template for data scientists and engineers seeking to apply machine learning to financial security challenges.
