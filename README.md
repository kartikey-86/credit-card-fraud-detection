# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent based on transaction data. 

Uses the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and demonstrates best practices for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
